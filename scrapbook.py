You are an expert safety analyst reviewing inspection comments from offshore drilling operations. Please analyze the following safety inspection comments to identify patterns, themes, and insights.

DATASET CONTEXT:
- Total Comments: {len(df['COMMENT'].dropna())}
- Date Range: {df['INSPECTION_DATE'].min()} to {df['INSPECTION_DATE'].max()}
- Sites: {df['SITE_NAME'].nunique() if 'SITE_NAME' in df.columns else 'Unknown'}
- Facility Areas: {df['FACILITY_AREA'].nunique() if 'FACILITY_AREA' in df.columns else 'Unknown'}
- Response Types: {list(df['RESPONSE'].unique()) if 'RESPONSE' in df.columns else 'Unknown'}

SAMPLE COMMENTS FOR ANALYSIS:
"""
    
    # Add sample comments to prompt
    for i, comment_data in enumerate(sample_comments[:100], 1):  # Limit to 100 for prompt length
        prompt += f"""
{i}. Response: {comment_data['response_type']} | Site: {comment_data['site']} | Area: {comment_data['facility']}
   Comment: "{comment_data['comment']}"
"""
    
    prompt += f"""

ANALYSIS REQUESTED:

1. COMMON THEMES AND PATTERNS:

   - For each theme, provide:
     * Theme name and description
     * Frequency/prevalence 
     * Exact quote examples from the comments above
     * Which sites/areas this theme appears most in

2. POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS:
   - Identify positive safety practices mentioned
   - Good examples of compliance and safety measures
   - Effective procedures being followed
   - Provide exact quotes showing these positive observations
   - Quantify how often positive observations occur

3. COMMON ISSUES AND CONCERNS:
   - Most frequently mentioned safety issues
   - Recurring problems across different sites/areas
   - Equipment or procedural concerns
   - Provide exact quotes highlighting these issues
   - Assess severity and frequency of issues

4. OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT (OFI):
   - Areas where improvements are suggested
   - Recurring suggestions for better practices
   - Equipment or training needs mentioned
   - Provide exact quotes showing improvement opportunities

5. SITE-SPECIFIC PATTERNS:
   - Are there patterns specific to certain sites?
   - Do different facility areas have different types of issues?
   - Provide examples with exact quotes

6. RESPONSE TYPE ANALYSIS:
   - How do comments differ between "Effective" vs "Ineffective" responses?
   - What characterizes effective vs ineffective observations?
   - Provide comparative examples with exact quotes

7. RISK CATEGORIES:
   - Categorize the safety risks mentioned (e.g., equipment, procedural, environmental)
   - Rank by frequency and potential severity
   - Provide examples for each category

8. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
   - Overall safety culture assessment based on comments
   - Top 3 strengths identified
   - Top 3 areas needing attention
   - Key recommendations for management

FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Use clear headings and bullet points
- Include exact quotes in quotation marks with the comment number reference
- Provide statistics where possible (e.g., "appears in 23% of comments")
- Bold key findings
- End with actionable recommendations

Please be thorough and specific in your analysis, ensuring all findings are supported by exact examples from the provided comments.
